Free `recode' converts files between various character sets and surfaces.

Usage: recode [OPTION]... [ [CHARSET] | REQUEST [FILE]... ]

If a long option shows an argument as mandatory, then it is mandatory
for the equivalent short option also.  Similarly for optional arguments.

Listings:
  -l, --list[=FORMAT]        list one or all known charsets and aliases
  -k, --known=PAIRS          restrict charsets according to known PAIRS list
  -h, --header[=[LN/]NAME]   write table NAME on stdout using LN, then exit
  -F, --freeze-tables        write out a C module holding all tables
  -T, --find-subsets         report all charsets being subset of others
  -C, --copyright            display Copyright and copying conditions
      --help                 display this help and exit
      --version              output version information and exit

Operation modes:
  -v, --verbose           explain sequence of steps and report progress
  -q, --quiet, --silent   inhibit messages about irreversible recodings
  -f, --force             force recodings even when not reversible
  -t, --touch             touch the recoded files after replacement
  -i, --sequence=files    use intermediate files for sequencing passes
      --sequence=memory   use memory buffers for sequencing passes
  -p, --sequence=pipe     use pipe machinery for sequencing passes

Fine tuning:
  -s, --strict           use strict mappings, even loose characters
  -d, --diacritics       convert only diacritics or alike for HTML/LaTeX
  -S, --source[=LN]      limit recoding to strings and comments as for LN
  -c, --colons           use colons instead of double quotes for diaeresis
  -g, --graphics         approximate IBMPC rulers by ASCII graphics
  -x, --ignore=CHARSET   ignore CHARSET while choosing a recoding path

Option -l with no FORMAT nor CHARSET list available charsets and surfaces.
FORMAT is `decimal', `octal', `hexadecimal' or `full' (or one of `dohf').
Unless DEFAULT_CHARSET is set in environment, CHARSET defaults to the locale
dependent encoding, determined by LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LANG.
With -k, possible before charsets are listed for the given after CHARSET,
both being tabular charsets, with PAIRS of the form `BEF1:AFT1,BEF2:AFT2,...'
and BEFs and AFTs being codes are given as decimal numbers.
LN is some language, it may be `c', `perl' or `po'; `c' is the default.

REQUEST is SUBREQUEST[,SUBREQUEST]...; SUBREQUEST is ENCODING[..ENCODING]...
ENCODING is [CHARSET][/[SURFACE]]...; REQUEST often looks like BEFORE..AFTER,
with BEFORE and AFTER being charsets.  An omitted CHARSET implies the usual
charset; an omitted [/SURFACE]... means the implied surfaces for CHARSET; a /
with an empty surface name means no surfaces at all.  See the manual.

If none of -i and -p are given, presume -p if no FILE, else -i.
Each FILE is recoded over itself, destroying the original.  If no
FILE is specified, then act as a filter and recode stdin to stdout.
